    "descricao": "Dying Light 2 brings to life a unique post-apocalyptic vision of the Modern Dark Ages - a brutal, bleak and unforgiving reality where you are as likely to perish at the hand of a human as you are by the infected. \r\n\r\nIn this exhausted world, your quick thinking, exceptional parkour abilities and brutal combat skills are the only things that let you dive into darkness and emerge alive. Make morally grey decisions and witness how they impact the world at multiple levels, shape the transformation of the City, and ultimately decide its fate.",
